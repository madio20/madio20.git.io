  <h2>Hello! My name is Madison Piehler.</h2>
<p> I am a hardworking graphic design student at Assumption University with a double music major. I am also an accomplished musician in flute and alto saxophone. My colleagues would describe me as smart, kind, and determined. I believe that music and art are keys to self-expression which is important to everyday life. My goal is to make people smile and inspire them to do what they wish.</p>    
<p>One of my interests is music. I have been playing instruments ever since I was around 9 years old! I first started with the flute then alto saxophone in middle school and high school. I have played in multiple types of bands throughtout high school and college. These bands include Concert Band, Jazz Band, Marching Band and even the Pit Band for multiple musicals and show choir. I even decided to pursue a degree in music when I first went to college. One semester after transferring to Assumption University, my advisor and I decided to add Graphic Design to my studies. Another interest of mine is art. I always loved art and looking at art. But I really pursued art when I started my Graphic Design degree at Assumption University. I took various art and design classes from photography to drawing. I felt like I was behind because I did not take any art classes in high school or at Anna Maria. But I tried my best and ultimately got better at art and design with some practice. /p>
